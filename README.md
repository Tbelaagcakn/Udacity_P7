My submission for the Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Project as part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The project looked at some of the emails and data from the Enron scandal and the idea was to try see if we could predict "Persons of Interest" (POI) using machine learning. This is done mostly in the Python library sklearn.

This is my submission, written by myself so you should not attempt to submit this as your own.
